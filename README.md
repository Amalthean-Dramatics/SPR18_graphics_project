## Basic Triangles
Based on the code provided, we modified the code to appear as follows:

![Inverted Triforce, with shapes filled](images/full_inv_tri.png)
![Inverted Triforce, with wireform edge](images/wire_inv_tri.png)

The `m` key can be pressed to cycle between the three polygon display modes
provided by OpenGL.

## Museum Plans
* Multi-Themed Museum, with each room having its own theme, or variation on a
  theme. We are not quite sure what our final plan will be. Meow Wolf's House of
  Eternal Return seems like it may be a inspiration.
* We are planning on starting with 4 rooms, with the ability to add more if we
  feel that we don't have enough to do already :laughing:.
* We would like for one room to be a topological map room (entire room is a
  topological map) - the _room_ is the sculpture....
* We are unsure about whether or not we will have a ceiling at the moment. 
* This is a sculpture we'd like to place in the museum:
 ![first sculpture](images/sculpture.png)
* We are also undecided about what forms/placements/images that we want to use
  for paintings. This is something that we are working on.
* We have not started looking for textures for the surfaces in the museum --
  This is something that will depend on the theming of each room, and that too
  has not been settled upon.

Added basic layout of museum as a blender file in the models directory. If you
want a plain link, try [here](models)

Added some model loader functionality. Running into compilation errors with
regards to the order in which header files are processed.

Loads the model correctly, but seems to have some rendering errors on some
computers (memory issues?).
